# yaml-front-matter-validator
The `yaml-front-matter-validator` is a Python script that validates the YAML front matter in markdown (`.md`) files. The script recursively searches through a specified directory, parsing the YAML front matter of each markdown file, and outputs an error message along with the file path if there's a YAML syntax error.
